# Writing clean and configurable Machine Learning code using R and the config package--a practical example


### Most beginners write their machine learning code with all configurable values hardcoded. Changing a value often means searching entire code and making changes in multiple places.

The code under this repository demonstrate the use of the config package in R, using a practical machine learning example with code. In the process, I also utilize the R caret package to train a classification algorithm and uses the final model to make predictions.
