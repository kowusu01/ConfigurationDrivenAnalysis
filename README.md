# Writing clean and configurable Machine Learning code using R and the config package--a practical example

![alt text](https://github.com/kowusu01/ConfigurationDrivenAnalysis/blob/main/software-configuration.jpeg?raw=true)

### Most beginners write their machine learning code with all configurable values hardcoded. Changing a value often means searching entire code and making changes in multiple places.

The code under this repository demonstrate the use of the config package in R, using a practical machine learning example with code. In the process, I also utilize the R caret package to train a classification algorithm and uses the final model to make predictions.
